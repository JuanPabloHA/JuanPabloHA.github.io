Iâ€™m an apsiring data scientist passionate about using technology and harnessing the predictive potential of different data analysis and modelling tools to improve the life quality of people and communities.
Continuously trying to understand particular needs, constraints and scope of a project before selecting an appropriate set of tools and technologies to address the problem and communicate results and findings effectively.
Confident utilising Python and SQL for data integration and modelling. Also have experience with the R programming language as well as git for collaborative workflow. My preferred tool for working with spatial data is QGIS alongside PyQGIS for automation and reproducibility.
