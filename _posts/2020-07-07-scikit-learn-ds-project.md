## Seoul Bike Sharing

The Seoul bike sharing demand data set is hosted in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The data set contains the count of the number of bikes rented at each hour in the Seoul bike-sharing system and information regarding weather conditions. 

The complete code for the project can be found in my [Seoul bike-sharing repository](https://github.com/JuanPabloHA/Seoul_Bike_Sharing/tree/main/notebooks). The project consists of a simple example of an end to end data science project that aims to build a system that predicts the demand for bicycles at each hour for any given day.
