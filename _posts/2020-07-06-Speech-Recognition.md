# Tensor Flow speech recognition challenge

Convolutional neural networks are a powerful form of neural networks. Their coverage ranges from classifying images and identifying multiple objects in a video feed, to writing or responding to real-time conversations. Most of these convolutional networks are several layers deep and use data in a matrix form. This example focuses on a different kind of shallow neural network that uses one-dimensional array-shaped data to build a simple speech recognition system that classifies raw audio files into 30 different categories without requiring additional acoustic or language models. The system consists of a combination of 1D convolutions with fully connected dense layers and data augmentation in the form of noise injection. Our study shows that 1D convolutions are suitable for the feature extraction of raw audio signals and combined with fully connected layers, it can achieve a competent validation accuracy considering the low footprint and hardware requirements.
